This website serves the purpose of documenting progress throughout my 3rd year Data Science module. I will update this throughout the term, until my project has culminated .
The tabs at the top of the page take you to the following pages: Final Project shows the work that shall be marked. Portfolio shows the material created throughout the module as I learn. GitHub takes you to the websites code repository. Please note, if you hover your cursor over any chart, it will zoom in, for an easy viewing process.

   <h2>USA vs China: A New World Order?</h2>

<p>For over a century, the USA has been the dominant world superpower. This project aims to analyse the extent to which China is challenging that title.<p> 

      
                  <hr/>

        <h3> Wealth of a Nation</h3>
        
<p> I begin by analysing the wealth of the Chinese and USA populations. I do so by looking at the Mean and Median Wealth, as well as analysing the share of world's high net worth individuals in each country. This data was sourced from the <a href = "https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/research/publications/global-wealth-report-2021-en.pdf" id="intextlink">Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report 2021</a>. This is a PDF, so I used Excel's 'Data from Picture' Function to change screenshots of the report into CSV files. The Mean and Median Wealth data is displayed on two World Maps, whilst the high net worth distribution is displayed in Pie Chart format.</p> 
        
    
    <div class= "map" id="Chart1"></div>
    <div class= "map" id="Chart2"></div>
    <p>Files used:</p>
      <p>world.geo.json</p>
      <p>projectmapmean.json</p>
        <p>projectmapmedian.json</p>
        <p>worldwealth2021.csv</p>
<p>My project does not contain many APIs due to Chinese data being hard to come across in well structured API's such as in The World Bank API or OECD API, hence, most data comes via csv files from datascraping of websites or PDF sources.</p>
<p>These maps show that the USA is still far ahead of China in terms of Mean and Median wealth of their population. However, it is clear that inequality is higher in the USA, as the mean wealth has a much higher difference to the median when compared to China. This is made clearer in my later Bubble Chart where we see China's Gini Index being lower than the US. Inequality can lead to social unrest which can cause increasing political issues for a nation.</p>

       
    <div class="pie-chart-grid">
  
      <div class= "pie-chart" id="Chart3"></div>
      <div class= "pie-chart" id="Chart4"></div>

        <p>Files used:</p>
     <p>projectpie().json</p>
      <p>worldwealth2021.csv</p>
        <p>These pie charts were easily reproduced, as all the data was in the same format, with only the y field being changed for each respective wealth level.</p>
        <p>When it comes to high net-worth individuals, China is still a way off the US. However, when looking at ultra high net-worth ($100 million+), China is increasingly evenly matched. As implied by the GDP Forecast Chart below, this gap may continue to close with Chinas world share of high net-worth individuals looking to overtake the USA in future decades.</p>
                    <br>

        <h3> Forecasted GDP Growth</h3>
<p>I accessed the  <a href="https://data.oecd.org/api/" id="intextlink">OECD API</a>and used <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" id="intextlink">BeautifulSoup</a>to scrape the data on long-term forecasted real GDP from the EO dataset for China and the USA. This data was then stored in a <a href = "https://pandas.pydata.org/" id="intextlink">Pandas</a> dataframe, which allowed me to manipulate and analyze the data more efficiently. From there, I used the Pandas library to convert the data into a JSON object, as well as a CSV file for visualization. This can be seen in my <a href = "https://github.com/olilambourn/olilambourn.github.io/blob/main/OECDGDPForecast.ipynb" id="intextlink">Google Colab</a>file.</p>
    <p>It is an established fact that China has surpassed the United States in terms of GDP and is anticipated to continue widening the gap in the foreseeable future. This alteration in the economic power dynamic between the two countries may have substantial implications for the balance of power between them.</p>

         <p>Files used:</p>
      <p>OECDGDPForecast.ipynbn</p>

 <h3>Population</h3>
   <p>Below I display population pyramids for China and the US. The data was downloaded in csv format with ease from a link on <a href="https://www.populationpyramid.net/" id="intextlink">this website</a> which they originally sourced from the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, UN. </p>
<p> The age structure of a nations population is informative about the future. Both nations indicate a structure where the middle-aged population make up a larger segment of the population and the younger cohorts have gotten smaller over time. The problem is worse in China but still problematic in the US. In addition, China has a much less balanced ppulation with more males in every bracket below 65.</p>

       <p> Below is a bar chart presenting Human Development Index figures with China and USA highlighted. I <a href= "https://github.com/olilambourn/olilambourn.github.io/blob/main/HDI.ipynb" id="intextlink">scraped</a> this data from <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index" id="intextlink">Wikipedia</a> (sourced from UN Development Programme) from  using BeautifulSoup and Panda to manipulate and store the data effectively.</p>
        <p>The HDI is a composite of measures of a nation including health, knowledge and standard of living. Whilst the US is ranked 21st and China 79th, it is again the trend that is important to look at. In <a href= "https://countryeconomy.com/hdi?year=1990" id="intextlink">1990</a> the US was ranked 2nd whilst China was 103rd.</p>
    <div class= "rectangle-chart" id="Chart16"></div>

        <p> The below bubble chart compares Education Expenditure per Student, Average Wages and the Gini Coefficient of USA and China between 2010-2019. This data was compiled from a number of locations. Chinese <a href="https://github.com/olilambourn/olilambourn.github.io/blob/main/ChinaEducationSpend.ipynb" id="intextlink">education expenditure<a/> was scraped using BeautifulSoup and Pandas. The rest was compiled in csv format from the OECD website using excel.</p>
            <p> We see China has undergone a rapid upward trend in wages and education spending, coupled with falling inequality. The US has seen a rapid upward trend in education spending, with a slow rise in wages and a slight rise in inequality. <p/>

   <p> This project has laid the foundations of analysis of China's rising position in the Geopolitical sphere of influence. Further analysis of the cost of rising inequality in the US, the effect of US and Chinese political instability and the educational attainment levels per dollar spent are where I would focus additional research to further the study.</p>
