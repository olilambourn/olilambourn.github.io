    <h2>USA vs China: A New World Order?</h2>

    <p>For over a century, the USA has been the dominant world superpower. This project aims to analyse the extent to which China is challenging that title.<p>

    <hr/>

    <h3>Wealth of a Nation</h3>

    <p>I begin by analysing the wealth of the Chinese and USA populations. I do so by looking at the Mean and Median Wealth, as well as analysing the share of world's high net worth individuals in each country. This data was sourced from the <a href = "https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/research/publications/global-wealth-report-2021-en.pdf" id="intextlink">Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report 2021</a>. This is a PDF, so I used Excel's 'Data from Picture' Function to change screenshots of the report into CSV files. The Mean and Median Wealth data is displayed on two World Maps, whilst the high net worth distribution is displayed in Pie Chart format.</p>

    <!-- This div contains a grid of maps -->
    <div class="map-grid">
      <div class= "map" id="Chart1"></div>
      <div class= "map" id="Chart2"></div>
    </div>

    <p>Files used:</p>
    <p>world.geo.json</p>
    <p>projectmapmean.json</p>
    <p>projectmapmedian.json</p>
    <p>worldwealth2021.csv</p>

   

<p>My project does not contain many APIs due to Chinese data being hard to come across in well structured API's such as in The World Bank API or OECD API, hence, most data comes via csv files from datascraping of websites or PDF sources.</p>
<p>These maps show that the USA is still far ahead of China in terms of Mean and Median wealth of their population. However, it is clear that inequality is higher in the USA, as the mean wealth has a much higher difference to the median when compared to China. This is made clearer in my later Bubble Chart where we see China's Gini Index being lower than the US. Inequality can lead to social unrest which can cause increasing political issues for a nation.</p>

       <!-- This div contains a grid of pie charts -->
    <div class="pie-chart-grid">
  
      <div class= "pie-chart" id="Chart3"></div>
      <div class= "pie-chart" id="Chart4"></div>
      <div class= "pie-chart" id="Chart5"></div>
      <div class= "pie-chart" id="Chart6"></div>

    </div>
        <p>Files used:</p>
     <p>projectpie().json</p>
      <p>worldwealth2021.csv</p>
        <p>These pie charts were easily reproduced, as all the data was in the same format, with only the y field being changed for each respective wealth level. This allowed for quick replication charts.</p>
        <p>When it comes to high net-worth individuals, China is still a way off the US. However, when looking at ultra high net-worth ($100 million+), China is increasingly evenly matched. As implied by the GDP Forecast Chart below, this gap may continue to close with Chinas world share of high net-worth individuals looking to overtake the USA in future decades.</p>
                    <br>

        <h3> Looking Forward: GDP Growth</h3>
<p>I accessed the  <a href="https://data.oecd.org/api/" id="intextlink">OECD API</a> and used <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" id="intextlink">BeautifulSoup</a> to scrape the data on long-term forecasted real GDP from the EO dataset for China and the USA. This data was then stored in a <a href = "https://pandas.pydata.org/" id="intextlink">Pandas</a> dataframe, which allowed me to manipulate and analyze the data more efficiently. From there, I used the Pandas library to convert the data into a JSON object, as well as a CSV file for visualization. This can be seen in my <a href = "https://github.com/olilambourn/olilambourn.github.io/blob/main/OECDGDPForecast.ipynb" id="intextlink">Google Colab</a> file. The use of API means data will be refreshed automatically when the code is run, resulting in efficient automation of data.</p>
    <p>It is an established fact that China has surpassed the United States in terms of GDP and is anticipated to continue widening the gap in the foreseeable future. This alteration in the economic power dynamic between the two countries may have substantial implications for the balance of power between them.</p>

 <h3>Population and Social Characteristics</h3>
   <p>Below I display population pyramids for China and the US. The data was downloaded in csv format with ease from a link on <a href="https://www.populationpyramid.net/" id="intextlink">this website</a> which they originally sourced from the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, UN. </p>
<p> The age structure of a nations population is informative about the future. Both nations indicate a structure where the middle-aged population make up a larger segment of the population whilst the younger cohorts have reduced in size over time. In the future, both nations will have a large dependent elderly population resulting in huge social welfare costs. The problem is greater in China but still problematic in the US. China also has an incredibly unbalanced gender with more males in every bracket below 65, a serious societal problem.</p>

       <!-- This paragraph describes the Human Development Index chart and how the data was obtained -->
<p>Below is a bar chart presenting Human Development Index figures with China and USA highlighted. I <a href= "https://github.com/olilambourn/olilambourn.github.io/blob/main/HDI.ipynb" id="intextlink">scraped</a> this data from <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index" id="intextlink">Wikipedia</a> (sourced from UN Development Programme) from using BeautifulSoup and Panda to manipulate and store the data effectively.</p>

<!-- This paragraph provides context for the HDI chart -->
<p>The HDI is a composite of measures of a nation including health, knowledge and standard of living. Whilst the US is ranked 21st and China 79th, it is again the trend that is important to look at. In <a href= "https://countryeconomy.com/hdi?year=1990" id="intextlink">1990</a> the US was ranked 2nd whilst China was 103rd.</p>

<!-- This paragraph describes the bubble chart and how the data was obtained -->
        <p> The below bubble diagram compares Education Expenditure per Student, Average Wages and the Gini Coefficient of USA and China between 2010-2019. This data was compiled from a number of locations. Chinese <a href="https://github.com/olilambourn/olilambourn.github.io/blob/main/ChinaEducationSpend.ipynb" id="intextlink">education expenditure<a/> was scraped using BeautifulSoup and Pandas. The rest was compiled in csv format from the OECD website using excel.</p>
            <p> We see China has undergone a rapid upward trend in wages and education spending, coupled with falling inequality. The US has seen a rapid upward trend in education spending, with a slow rise in wages and a slight rise in inequality. <p/>

        <h3>Military Might</h3>
        <p>The military is a crucial aspect of a nation's ability to project power globally, as it serves as the primary means for protecting national interests and upholding international order. The size, capabilities, and effectiveness of a nation's military are often used as indicators of its relative global power, with larger and more technologically advanced militaries generally commanding greater respect and influence on the world stage. Lack of structured databases made compiling and comparing data on respective militaries difficult.</p>
        <p> Below is a bubble diagram comparing gross military spending, military spending as a % of GDP and military personnel sizes beween China and USA from 2000-2019. I downloaded data into CSV format from <a href="https://milex.sipri.org/sipri" id="intextlink">Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</a> to create this chart.</p>
        <p> We see rises in gross spending for both China and US, a slight fall in Chinas spending as a % of GDP and a rise then fall for the US. The US spends significantly more on its military, whilst China has a much larger personnel base throughtout the period.<p/>
    <div class= "bubble" id="Chart13"></div>

        <h3>Political Health</h3>
         <p>The below bar chart presents Political Stability Index figure for 2021. I <a href="https://github.com/olilambourn/olilambourn.github.io/blob/main/politicalstabilityindex.ipynb" id="intextlink">scraped</a> the data from <a href="https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/wb_political_stability/" id="intextlink">The Global Economy website</a>. The website sourced data from <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/home" id="intextlink">The World Bank</a>. Scraping the data allowed for efficient manipulation of the number of countries data used.</p>
        <p>The political health of the US and China affect their global power. In the US, issues like polarization and gridlock may weaken its ability to address challenges, reducing its global influence. China has strengthened political control to maintain stability and pursue domestic and international agendas, but these measures have also attracted criticism and backlash, damaging its reputation and soft power.</p>
  <p> The data shows neiher US and China are both poltically stable, with China's political system being significantly less stable according to this metric.</p>
        <div class= "rectangle-chart" id="Chart15"></div>
        <p>Files used:</p>

        <hr/>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p> I ran into challenges of obtaining data throughout the project. The lack of API's that contained data from China resulted in the need for data scraping of multipe websites using BeautifulSoup and Pandas. This allowed me to manipulate data to display it effectively. However, it means the automation of the website is lacking and will need to be continously manually updated for many of the charts to stay up to date.</p>
   <hr/>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p> This project has laid the foundations of analysis of China's rising position in the Geopolitical sphere of influence. It is clear from the data presented that China has become a contender as one of the worlds top superpowers. However, it is not possible to conclude it has overtaken the US to become the leading power. Further analysis of the cost of rising inequality in the US, the effect of US and Chinese political instability, more in-depth military comparison and the educational attainment levels per dollar spent are where I would focus additional research to further the study.</p>
