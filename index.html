    <h2>USA vs China: A New World Order?</h2>

    <p>For over a century, the USA has been the dominant world superpower. This project aims to analyse the extent to which China is challenging that title.<p>

    <hr/>

    <h3>Wealth of a Nation</h3>

    <p>I begin by analysing the wealth of the Chinese and USA populations. I look at the Mean and Median Wealth, and analyse each nations share of high net worth individuals. This data was sourced from the <a href = "https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/research/publications/global-wealth-report-2021-en.pdf" id="intextlink">Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report 2021</a>. This is a PDF, so I used Excel's 'Data from Picture' Function to change screenshots of the report into CSV files.</p>

    <!-- This div contains a grid of maps -->
    <div class="map-grid">
      <div class= "map" id="Chart1"></div>
      <div class= "map" id="Chart2"></div>
    </div>

    <p>Files used:</p>
    <p>world.geo.json</p>
    <p>projectmapmean.json</p>
    <p>projectmapmedian.json</p>
    <p>worldwealth2021.csv</p>

   

<p>My project does not contain many APIs due to Chinese data being hard to come across in API's, hence, most data comes via csv files from datascraping of websites or download options.</p>
<p>These maps show the USA is well ahead of China in Mean and Median wealth of their population. However, inequality is higher in the USA, as the mean wealth has a much higher difference to the median when compared to China. This is made clearer later where we see China's Gini Index is lower than the US.</p>

       <!-- This div contains a grid of pie charts -->
    <div class="pie-chart-grid">

      <p>worldwealth2021.csv</p>
        <p>When it comes to high net-worth individuals, China is a way off the US. When looking at ultra high net-worth, China is more evenly matched. If backed by the GDP trend shown below, this gap may continue to close.</p>
                    <br>
          <hr/>

        <h3> Looking Forward: GDP Growth</h3>
<p>I accessed the  <a href="https://data.oecd.org/api/" id="intextlink">OECD API</a> and used <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" id="intextlink">BeautifulSoup</a> to scrape the data on long-term forecasted real GDP for China and the USA. This data was then stored in a <a href = "https://pandas.pydata.org/" id="intextlink">Pandas</a> dataframe, allowing me to manipulate and analyze the data efficiently. I used the Pandas library to convert the data into a JSON object, as well as a CSV file for visualization. This can be seen in my <a href = "https://github.com/olilambourn/olilambourn.github.io/blob/main/OECDGDPForecast.ipynb" id="intextlink">Google Colab</a> file. The use of API means data will be refreshed automatically when the code is run, resulting in automation of data.</p>
    <p>It is a fact that China has surpassed the United States in GDP and is anticipated to continue widening the gap in the future. This alteration in the economic power dynamic may have substantial implications for the balance of power.</p>

 <h3>Population and Social Characteristics</h3>
   <p>I display population pyramids for China and the US. The data was downloaded in csv format from a link on <a href="https://www.populationpyramid.net/" id="intextlink">this website</a> which they originally sourced from the UN. </p>
<p> The age structure of a nations population is informative about the future. Both indicate a structure where the middle-aged population make up a larger segment of the population whilst the younger cohorts have reduced in size. In the future, both will have a largely dependent population resulting in huge social welfare costs. The problem is greater in China but still problematic in the US. China also has an incredibly unbalanced gender dynamic, with more males in every bracket below 65.</p>

       <!-- This paragraph describes the Human Development Index chart and how the data was obtained -->
<p>A bar chart presenting HDI figures. I <a href= "https://github.com/olilambourn/olilambourn.github.io/blob/main/HDI.ipynb" id="intextlink">scraped</a> this data from <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index" id="intextlink">Wikipedia</a> (source: UN) using BeautifulSoup and Panda to manipulate and store the data.</p>

<!-- This paragraph provides context for the HDI chart -->
<p>The HDI is a composite of social measures. Whilst the US is ranked 21st and China 79th, it is again the trend that is important to look at. In <a href= "https://countryeconomy.com/hdi?year=1990" id="intextlink">1990</a> the US was ranked 2nd whilst China was 103rd.</p>

<!-- This div contains the HDI chart -->
<div class= "rectangle-chart" id="Chart16"></div>

<p>Files used:</p>
<p>HDI.ipynb</p>
<p>HDI.csv</p>
<p>HDI.json</p>

<!-- This paragraph describes the bubble chart and how the data was obtained -->
        <p> The below bubble diagram compares Education Expenditure per Student, Average Wages and the Gini Coefficient between 2010-2019. Chinese <a href="https://github.com/olilambourn/olilambourn.github.io/blob/main/ChinaEducationSpend.ipynb" id="intextlink">education expenditure<a/> was scraped using BeautifulSoup and Pandas. The rest was compiled in csv format from the OECD website using excel.</p>
            <p> We see China has undergone a rapid upward trend in wages and education spending, coupled with falling inequality. The US has seen a rapid upward trend in education spending, with a slow rise in wages and a slight rise in inequality. <p/>
    <div class= "bubble" id="Chart12"></div>
        <p>Files used:</p>
        <p>ChinaEducationSpend.ipynb</p>

        <hr/>
        
        <h3>Military Might</h3>
        <p>The military is a crucial aspect of a nation's ability to project hard-power globally. Lack of structured databases made compiling data on respective militaries difficult.</p>
        <p> Below is a bubble diagram comparing gross military spending, military spending as a % of GDP and military personnel sizes between 2000-2019. I downloaded data into CSV format from <a href="https://milex.sipri.org/sipri" id="intextlink">Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</a> to create this chart.</p>
        <p> We see rises in gross spending for both China and US, a slight fall in Chinas spending as a % of GDP and a rise then fall for the US. The US spends significantly more on its military, whilst China has a much larger personnel base throughout the period.<p/>

        <h3>Political Health</h3>
         <p>The below bar chart presents Political Stability Index figures for 2021. I <a href="https://github.com/olilambourn/olilambourn.github.io/blob/main/politicalstabilityindex.ipynb" id="intextlink">scraped</a> the data from <a href="https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/wb_political_stability/" id="intextlink">The Global Economy website</a>. The website sourced data from <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/home" id="intextlink">The World Bank</a>. Scraping the data allowed for efficient manipulation of the number of countries data used.</p>
        <p>The political health of the US and China affect their global power.</p>
  <p> The data shows that the US is not poltically stable, but China's significantly less stable.</p>
        <div class= "rectangle-chart" id="Chart15"></div>
        <p>Files used:</p>
        <p>political_stability.csv</p>
        <p>politicalstability.json</p>
        <p>politicalstabilityindex.ipynb</p>
        <hr/>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>The lack of API's that contained data from China resulted in data scraping of multiple websites. This allowed me to manipulate data to display it effectively. However, it means the automation of the website is lacking and will need to be manually updated to stay relevant.</p>
   <hr/>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p> This project has laid the foundations of analysis of China's rising position in the position. It is clear from the data presented that China has become a contender as one of the world;s top superpowers. However, it is not possible to conclude it has overtaken the US to become the leading power in a New World Order. Further analysis of the cost of rising inequality in the US, the effect of US and Chinese political instability, more in-depth military comparison and the educational attainment levels per dollar spent are where I would focus additional research to further the study.</p>
